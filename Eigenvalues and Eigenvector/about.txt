About Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Overview
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra with wide applications in various fields. They are used to understand the behavior of linear transformations and systems of linear equations.


Eigenvalues
Eigenvalues are scalar values that represent the scaling factor by which eigenvectors are stretched or compressed when transformed by a matrix. They provide valuable insights into the properties of linear transformations, such as stretching, rotating, or scaling.

Eigenvectors
Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that are transformed by a matrix only by a scalar factor, known as the corresponding eigenvalue. They represent the directions along which the linear transformation has the simplest behavior.

Eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent and form a basis for the vector space. They play a crucial role in diagonalizing matrices and solving systems of linear differential equations.
